## Location to Correct

**Feature Name**: 
(From coordinates.csv)

**Current Coordinates**:
- Latitude: 
- Longitude: 

## Proposed Correction

**Corrected Coordinates**:
- Latitude: 
- Longitude: 

**Coordinate Shift**: 
(meters, if known)

## Reason for Correction

**Issue with Current Coordinates**:
- [ ] Georeferencing error
- [ ] Improved data source available
- [ ] Measurement error
- [ ] Feature misidentification
- [ ] Other: 

**Detailed Explanation**:


## Supporting Evidence

**New Data Source**:
- Dataset name: 
- Resolution: 
- Acquisition date: 
- URL: 

**Verification Method**:
- [ ] Higher resolution LiDAR
- [ ] GPS field measurement
- [ ] Improved georeferencing
- [ ] Cross-reference with historic maps
- [ ] Other: 

**Screenshots/Comparisons**:
(Drag and drop images showing old vs new coordinates)

## Impact Assessment

**Does this change affect**:
- [ ] Feature description
- [ ] Confidence level
- [ ] Alignment with projected path
- [ ] Proximity to other features

**Recommended Changes to Other Fields**:


## Additional Notes
